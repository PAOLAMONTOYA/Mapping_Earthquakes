# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Scope
#### The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. This was best represetned by using 3 different styles of graph to show the effects of the earthquake and their relative location it was impacted at.

One of the styles were Geographical View which displayed more color of the landscape. It diaplayes where the earthquake occurred.

The other style was Dark which hid the landscape more and focused instead on the locations in general.
